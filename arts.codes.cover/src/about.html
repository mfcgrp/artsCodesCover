             <section>  <p><b>arts.codes</b> is a collective focusing on multiple forms of design/art with computational
                 underpinnings. We also function as a platform for open source distribution and creative
                 sharing—where artists, designers and engineers share articles, frameworks,
                 techniques, and code. Founded by Margaret Schedel and Melissa F. Clarke, both
                 interdisciplinary artists with a strong interest in community and education, arts.codes
                 was recently commissioned by Brookhaven’s Center for Functional Nanomaterials to
                 create a VR experience and sculpture showcasing how they measure atomic structures.
                 Other notable commissions include hacek for O’Reilly media and Schmoocon also a
                 virtual reality and installation piece. From 2017-2018  arts.codes was a member of New
                 Inc at the New Museum. Clarke and Schedel have shown their own work internationally
                 and both have been published in numerous journals, magazines and in releases. Clarke
                 was a former professor at Stony Brook University, is now the director of education at VR
                 World. Schedel is a tenured professor at Stony Brook University, teaching electronic
                 music, composition and interaction design. Sean Patrick, who recently joined the team,
                 is a Queens based cross-disciplinary developer, designer, and artist specializing in user
                 experience, human computer interaction, and creative interaction. Patrick has created
                 interactive apps, virtual reality experiences and has worked with machine learning to
                 create unique experiences.</p>
